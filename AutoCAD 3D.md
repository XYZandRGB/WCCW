# **Course Syllabus: AutoCAD 3D Fundamentals**  
**Course Code:** ACD-301  
**Duration:** 8 Weeks (16 Sessions)  
**Prerequisite:** Basic knowledge of AutoCAD 2D (drawing, modifying, layers, annotations)  

## **Course Description**  
This course introduces students to 3D modeling in AutoCAD, covering essential tools and techniques for creating, modifying, and presenting 3D designs. The curriculum balances interior design and engineering applications, ensuring students gain practical skills for real-world projects.  

---  
## **Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this course, students will be able to:  
- Navigate the AutoCAD 3D workspace efficiently.  
- Create and modify 3D objects using solid, surface, and mesh modeling.  
- Apply materials, lighting, and rendering for realistic presentations.  
- Generate 2D drawings from 3D models (floor plans, sections, elevations).  
- Develop 3D models for both interior design (furniture, spaces) and engineering (mechanical parts, structural elements).

## **Course Outline**  

### **Week 1: Introduction to AutoCAD 3D**  
- Differences between 2D and 3D workflows  
- Navigating the 3D workspace (ViewCube, Orbit, Visual Styles)  
- Basic 3D coordinate systems (WCS vs. UCS)  

### **Week 2: Solid Modeling Basics**  
- Creating primitive solids (box, cylinder, sphere, etc.)  
- Boolean operations (Union, Subtract, Intersect)  
- Extrude, Revolve, Loft, and Sweep commands  
- *Lab Exercise:* Simple mechanical part / Interior design element (e.g., table)  

### **Week 3: Editing 3D Objects**  
- Press/Pull, Fillet, Chamfer in 3D  
- Slice, Shell, and 3D Align  
- *Lab Exercise:* Modifying a 3D model (engineering bracket / furniture piece)  

### **Week 4: Surface & Mesh Modeling**  
- Creating and editing surfaces  
- Mesh modeling for organic shapes (interior decor, product design)  
- Converting between solids, surfaces, and meshes  
- *Lab Exercise:* Curved furniture (sofa) / Engine casing  

### **Week 5: Working with Architectural & Interior Models**  
- Creating walls, doors, and windows in 3D  
- Customizing interior spaces (stairs, railings, fixtures)  
- Importing 3D furniture blocks  
- *Lab Exercise:* Small room layout / Structural framing  

### **Week 6: Engineering Applications**  
- Parametric constraints in 3D  
- Creating mechanical assemblies (nuts, bolts, gears)  
- Basic structural modeling (beams, columns)  
- *Lab Exercise:* Assembly of simple machine parts  

### **Week 7: Materials, Lighting, & Rendering**  
- Applying materials (wood, metal, glass)  
- Setting up natural and artificial lighting  
- Rendering high-quality images  
- *Lab Exercise:* Interior scene rendering / Product visualization  

### **Week 8: Documentation & Presentation**  
- Generating 2D views from 3D models (flatten, base view)  
- Creating sections and details  
- Exporting for 3D printing or BIM workflows  
- *Final Project:* Submit a complete 3D model with 2D documentation (interior space or mechanical component)
